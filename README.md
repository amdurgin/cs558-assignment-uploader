CS558-Assignment-Uploader
=========================

This javascript program takes the following arguments seperated by spaces as
ordered below:

* Name

* Password

* Assignment Number

* Path to the tar.gz assignment submission

What should be returned by the server is a response containing either the score
on the submission, the number of attempts, and the maximum score received so
far. If there was an issue with grading the 
assignment(bad format, timeout, etc.), then this will be indicated by the 
server response.
